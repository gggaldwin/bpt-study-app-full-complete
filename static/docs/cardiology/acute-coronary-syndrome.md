# Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)

## Overview
Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) is an umbrella term for situations where blood supplied to the heart muscle is suddenly blocked. This includes:
- ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)
- Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI)
- Unstable Angina

## Pathophysiology
- Usually caused by a rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque and subsequent thrombus formation.

## Diagnosis
- Clinical symptoms: chest pain, diaphoresis, dyspnoea.
- ECG: ST elevation, ST depression, T wave inversion (depending on the subtype).
- Troponin: elevated in NSTEMI/STEMI.
- **GRACE Score** and **TIMI Score** are used for risk stratification.

## Management
- MONA: Morphine, Oxygen, Nitrates, Aspirin
- Antiplatelets and anticoagulants
- Revascularisation (PCI or CABG) depending on risk
