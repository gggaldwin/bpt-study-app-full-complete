# Atrial Flutter

## Overview
Organised atrial rhythm, usually around 300 bpm, with a characteristic sawtooth pattern on ECG.

## ECG
- Regular flutter waves (sawtooth)
- Atrial rate ~300 bpm, variable AV block (e.g. 2:1 = ventricular rate 150 bpm)

## Management
- Similar to AF: rate/rhythm control + anticoagulation
- Catheter ablation often curative
